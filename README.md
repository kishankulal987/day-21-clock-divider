# Overview
The clk_divider module is a Verilog implementation of a clock divider that generates a lower-frequency clock signal from a high-frequency input clock. It divides the input clock frequency by a factor of 50,000,000, producing an output clock that toggles at half the divided frequency (e.g., a 100 MHz input clock results in a 2 Hz output clock).

Created: June 20, 2025
Revision: 0.01 - Initial version
Timescale: 1ns / 1ps
Ports

Port	Type	Description
clk	Input	Input clock signal (e.g., 100 MHz)
reset	Input	Active-high synchronous reset signal
clk_out	Output	Divided output clock signal (e.g., 2 Hz)
Functionality
The module uses a 26-bit counter to count 25,000,000 cycles of the input clock.
When the counter reaches 25,000,000, the output clock (clk_out) toggles, and the counter resets to zero.
An active-high synchronous reset signal (reset) resets the counter and output clock to zero.
The module is designed for use in FPGA or ASIC designs requiring a low-frequency clock derived from a high-frequency source.
Usage
Connect the clk input to a high-frequency clock source (e.g., 100 MHz system clock).
Connect the reset input to a control signal for synchronous reset.
Use the clk_out signal as the divided clock for downstream logic.
Ensure the input clock frequency is known to determine the output clock frequency (output frequency = input frequency / 50,000,000).
Dependencies
None
Notes
The counter width (26 bits) supports division up to 67,108,864 cycles. The current design uses 25,000,000 for division.
Modify the counter threshold (25'd25_000_000) to adjust the division ratio if needed.
The module is synchronous, operating on the positive edge of the input clock.
